## Get Started
1. **Initial Machine Setup**. Install Node.js and npm https://nodejs.org.
2. **Run the setup script**. `npm install`
3. **Run the app**. `npm start` to open project directory
This will run the automated build process, start up a webserver, and open the application in your default browser. When doing development, this command will continue watching all your files. Every time you hit save the code is rebuilt and the browser is reloaded.
